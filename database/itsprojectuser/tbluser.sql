Her school uniform consists of a black blouse with a white blazer, a white and grey plaid skirt and matching plaid tie.\r\n\r\nPersonality\r\nRize is a tough, cool, and headstrong girl who holds reasonable maturity over the others. She is bluntly opinionated but kind and wise, often offering advice towards the others. She can be a little bit of a tsundere at times, and she has a vivid active imagination that can get carried away. Deep down she loves cute things, cosplay, and fears that she may not fit in, but she gets flustered if others see her vulnerable side. As a result she may try to act like a \"normal\" teenage girl to appear more relate-able.\r\n\r\nAs her dad was a member of the military, Rize is very independent and physically strong.

She is also determined to be seen as a mature, older-sister type by others, but her highly clumsy nature usually discredits her attempts when she has to rely on someone else for help.\r\n\r\nNot helping is the fact she is somewhat air-headed, usually causing incidents for her or those surrounding her. She is extremely clumsy and struggles to stay focused unless the subject interests her- or involves food.

She is kind and somewhat withdrawn, but she can be sarcastic and blunt at times. She is quite jumpy and easily frightened, for example, when her friends tell ghost stories she covers her ears because she doesn\'t want to hear them, and she also has leporiphobia due to her not being able to walk home from school because a small wild rabbit was standing in her path and feared that it would attack her.\r\n\r\nSharo becomes very hyper and playful when under the influence of caffeine.

Unlike Nozomi, she appears rather stoic and skeptical in the early episodes, but it is shown that Eli is actually very kind and caring towards people who are close to her, like her little sister. She is also dependable as her grandmother entrusted her the responsibility of preventing the school from being shut down. Other than being admirable, Eli also has a lot of fans in the school. After she joined the group, their popularity rose and their ranking among the school idols increased, achieving more fame.\r\n\r\nHonoka also complimented her beauty, saying that she is beautiful, tall, and has a great body shape.

She claims that with her trumpet, she will become her own kind of special.[1] She cherishes her trumpet dearly, which was given to her by her parents when she was a junior high school student.\r\n\r\nThroughout the series, Reina appears to grow more empathetic, as she apologizes in later episodes for her rude behavior for the first time on screen.

Hachiman and Hayato see through he facade while others remain clueless.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by Hayato, she worries about her public image. She didn\'t want to lose the student council election in a way that would make her look bad. Although she has no issue with being seen around Hachiman who is \"hated\" in the school.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hachiman\'s observations, Iroha is an uncute Komachi, better Sagami, phony Meguri, different Kaori and inferior Haruno. He later deems her the \"the second most rotten person in the world\", the first obviously being himself. Hachiman feels that she is the type to be hated by other girls for her cuteness and her closeness to Hayama.\r\n\r\nShe lacks self confidence but this starts to change when she overhears Hachiman\'s request for \"something genuine\". And after the Christmas play is completed successfully.', 1, 2, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2018-06-27 06:41:55', 1),

Due to her adorable and childlike appearance, many characters say that she is very cute, and Vigne says that she\'s (the first time they met) like a doll, while Raphi stated that she is always cute no matter how, and her classmates who are in the cooking club say that she is adorable, and they even gave her a twintail hairstyle.', 1, 2, '2018-06-27 06:43:30', '2018-07-21 09:32:35', 2),
